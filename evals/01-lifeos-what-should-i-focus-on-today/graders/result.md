Judge only the first steps the assistant takes within its turn limit. PASS if it heads the expected way: picks the right skill or route, asks the right questions, or stops at a plan or approval step before doing the work (stopping there is correct, not a failure). Wording and extra detail are fine; a missing later step is fine. Expected direction: Routes to lifeos, checks the EntityOS connection, reads priorities with search_context, asks for missing priorities once and does not invent any. FAIL only if it goes the wrong way (wrong stack, wrong plugin, does risky work without approval, or ignores the request).
